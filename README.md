## Spring Code Jam Challenge - About the Project

This project consists of two parts - a landing page for a UX designer storytelling character, the other page is for the project that was built for a fictitious volunteer organization. To view the volunteer organization project page, simply click the link icon at the top right corner of the volunteer project card in Projects section on the first page.

## Features of the Landing Pages

1. Responsive web design.
2. Subtle hover effects when the user hovers over selective elements.
3. When the user hovers over specific elements, subtle hover effects appear.

## Technologies and Standards Used in UI/UX

**There are various tools that have been used throughout the project design and development:**
| Tools | Usage |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| [TinyPng](https://tinypng.com/) | For JPEG/PNG Image Compression |
| [Photopae](https://www.photopea.com/) | For editing and refining images |
| [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) | For parsing CSS and adds vendor prefixes |

## Technologies and Standards Used in Frontend Development

**The technologies that have been used are:**

1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
3. JavaScript

### ![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

- **Javascript** has been used to add a subtle winking feature and functionality to mobile menu and image gallery.

**The main concepts that have been emphasized are:**

1. Responsive Web Design
2. [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
3. [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

The website is using [BEM — Block Element Modifier](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology to create reusable and understandable components in CSS. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. We are also using [Nested BEM File structure organization](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/#nested) for CSS.

## Future Improvements
